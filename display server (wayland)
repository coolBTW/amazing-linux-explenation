Whats a display server?




it has a couple of responsibilitiis.
Display Output--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
recives commands to show stuff on the screen from GUI apps.
Figures out where to place it. so that apps dont just randomly appear or be placed somewhere outside the screen
 
acts as a translator and a coordinator from commands of gui apps to the gpu. that displays it. 


so, it takes commands from GUI apps and sends a messege to the gpu (using drivers) to place that on the screen.
without one the commands from the gui apps will not know where or how to show, and just not display anything.


-fact checked with AI. written by hand. would advise fact checking on other trusted sources
